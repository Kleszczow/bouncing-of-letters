Project animation of bouncing random letters of any words.

This is an animation designed to animate strings. In the html file, we edit the p tag by adding any word of our choice. The letters are chosen randomly and are matched by the css-editable root value.

In the future, I wants to skip jumping up blank spaces and punctuation marks
