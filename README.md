Project animation of bouncing random letters of any words.

This is an animation designed to animate strings. In the html file, we edit the p tag by adding any word of our choice. The letters are chosen randomly and are matched by the css-editable root value.

punctuation marks such as: , . : ; and spaces are not animated. you can easily add more disabled characters in if, which is in the 20th line of the js code.
